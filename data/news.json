To scale RL, the foremost prerequisite is maintaining stable and robust training dynamics. However, we observe that existing RL algorithms (such as GRPO) exhibit severe instability issues during long training and lead to irreversible model collapse, hindering further performance improvements with increased com...",

With the bloom of multimodal pretraining, especially the unified model, we have witnessed the opportunity to building a generalist model that is capable of processing tasks of different modalities or multi-modalities! Thus, we propose OFA1, namely One-For-All, a unified multimodal pretrained model that unifies understanding and generation tasks concerning modalities into a single framework, and we pretrain OFA with the instruction-based multitask-pretraini...",
